For this assignment I was tasked with creating a gun range. I developed a gun that would shoot metal balls. When the metal ball collided with any object it should make a sound.
I also had to input sound on the gun so that on the click of the trigger it would make a gun fire. Each sound also had to be spatialized so that it sounded realistic. 
I also implemented lighting into my scene.
