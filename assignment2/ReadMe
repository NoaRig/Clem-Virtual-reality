For this assignment I was tasked with making a board where player can move around. The blue players move in random directions. red players follow a purple ball. 
Once they touch the ball it will teleport to a new location for them to go to. The black player is controlled by the user. Wherever the user clicks the player will move to.
The yellow player will follow the black player. There are also two tiles. If a player goes onto the red tile then thewy will be destroyed(excluding the black player).
If the black player moves over the green tile, then ine of the other players will be spawned.
