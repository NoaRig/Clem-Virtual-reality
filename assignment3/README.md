For this assignment, I was tasked with creating a playable character that can move around inside an environment. 
I also had to code in lighting features to make my user reflect light in certain environments.
I then had to develop different environments and code so that when my user moves to a certain point a new environment is generated.
This greatly helps with memory uusage since it wont be just one huge environment.
